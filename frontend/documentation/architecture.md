##Domain Driven Design vs Clean Code Architecture
Clean Code Architecture provides a very clean approach to split the file structure in a technical manner.

While the developer sees exactly which technical components are available, he gets no direct overview what the app currently does.
We need a good documentation that leads through the complete application.

A Domain Driven Design Architecture provides a good overview of the specific domains of the application. You see the functional or business context in one view by code structure.
