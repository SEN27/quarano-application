[[user.enrollment]]
== User enrollment

[[user.enrollment.resource]]
== The enrollment resource

If a user logs in an has not completed the tracking enrollment, a link relation named `enrollment` is contained in the response.
The link can be followed to obtain information about the state of the enrollment.

Depending on the state of the enrollment, the following link relations will be available in the response:

* `details` -- Access or submit personal details.
* `questionnaire` -- Access or submit the initial questionnaire.
* `encounters` -- Access or submit original encounters.
* `next` -- Available as long as the enrollment is not completed.

=== Submitting enrollment details

==== Zip code verification

The `zipCode` field of the payload submitted for the enrollment details is not only verified for syntactical correctness (a five-digit string) but also for whether the health department is actually responsible to manage people living in the given zip code.

Assume the original submission contains a syntactically invalid zip code (something other than 5 digits) or a syntactically correct one but one that's not a semantically valid one like 11111.

The server will respond with a `400 Bad Request` pointing out that somethings wrong with the zip code:

If a zip code is provided that is a valid one but one that the current health department is not responsible for the response will change to return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` and the response body will contain more detailed information about the problematic zip code:

The value of the `zipCode` field is now an object containing detailed information about the health department responsible for the given zip code.

Also, you can expect to find a link in the response that will provide you with the URI to be used in case the user wants to confirm the zip code she provided.
Clients then need to reissue the `PUT` request to mark the case as externally managed.
That call will then return a `200 OK` and contain a link to the main <<user.enrollment.resource, enrollment resource>>.
